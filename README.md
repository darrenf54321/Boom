# BOOM! Training WebApp

## Concept
Inspired by many failed training sessions in the local gym, a member of our group had an idea for an app which would help to organise gym sessions for groups of people.
Better groups would mean better progress. Better progress would mean more weight. More weight would mean maximum feel-good factor!
BOOM! was born!

## Product Development
